# notetaker

## Description
This is an application that can be used to write and save notes. It will use an Express.js back end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file. This application's front end was created already by default starter code. I built the back end and connected the back end to the front end.

## Usage
Enter a new note title in the bigger text box and the note details in the smaller text box. Once you've added text to these two sections, a save icon will appear in the top right corner of the page. Click it to save the note; it will populate in the left-hand column along with the existing saved notes. To create a new note, click the plus sign in the top right corner.
To view an existing note, click on its title. To delete a note, click the trash can displayed for that note.
To return to the landing page, click the 'Note Taker' button in the top left corner.
